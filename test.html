              <h4>Why Programming?</h4>
              <p>A lot of my work has been with fields that are adjacent to the tech industry. While I was in a library environment, I did a lot of trouble-shooting for users as they attempted to access and use our various databases. In that work I occasionally encountered pieces of code that I would take and use elsewhere. I've always been curious about the programming and I decided to take the plunge by diving into a boot camp at Epicodus in PDX.</p>
